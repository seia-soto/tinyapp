A project to check if in-app browser injects the script or not on specially for Korean apps.

## The status of this project

This project is greatly influenced by [Felix Krause](https://krausefx.com/blog/ios-privacy-instagram-and-facebook-can-track-anything-you-do-on-any-website-in-their-in-app-browser) who suggested that the in-app browser can be dangerous.
